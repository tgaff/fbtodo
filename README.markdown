# Purpose

This is a simple todo app based off the layout used by todomvc.com.  Basically, I wanted to try out firebase by building a quick app.  Firebase turned out to be an extremely easy tool to use for this.


# Usage 

To run: node server.js

To try: localhost:8080/todo.html

There's also a firebase sample at firebase_sample.html
It's based on https://www.firebase.com/tutorial/#session/iuqq5dz5dvm
